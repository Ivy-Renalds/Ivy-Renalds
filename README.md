- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ivy-Renalds
- 👀 I’m interested in anything space! I love old sci-fi, new Martian rover discoveries, and basically anything related to the cosmos!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do this whole life thing. But as for education, I'm attempting to learn code!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to the coding languages (specifically C+).
